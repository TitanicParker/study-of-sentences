# Study of Sentences – The Geometry of Coherence

A unified geometric framework showing how every coherent sentence expresses the same operator–invariant structure of meaning.
This project formalizes coherence as a 60° manifold composed of six operators, eighteen submodes, and fifty-four invariants.
Every sentence is understood as a closed walk across this manifold.

## Overview

The Study of Sentences reveals that meaning is not arbitrary, cultural, or linguistic—it is geometric.
All coherent sentences, regardless of language, follow the same structural pipeline:

- ∇ — Distinction  
- div — Expansion  
- curl — Relation  
- curl★ — Correction  
- ∇· — Integration  
- I — Closure  

These six operators move across a hexagonal coherence manifold and stabilize on one or more of 54 invariants, which represent the only stable forms meaning can take.
This framework provides a unified explanation for:

- why sentences feel complete  
- how language conveys meaning  
- how cognition stabilizes understanding  
- how thought moves  
- how coherence behaves in consciousness
