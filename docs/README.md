# Documentation — Structure, Theory, and Method

This directory houses the high-level documents that define, explain, and support
the Study of Sentences framework.

Included or planned:

- **The Manuscript**  
  A continuous exposition of the geometry of coherence, operators, submodes,
  invariants, purpose structures, and the hijack method.

- **The Core White Paper**  
  Formal statement of the system: the hexagonal coherence manifold, the six
  operators, the eighteen submodes, and the fifty-four invariants.

- **The Learning Log**  
  A structured record of discoveries, refinements, and theoretical insights as
  the project evolves.

- **The Coherence Suitcase**  
  Conceptual tools and reference diagrams for navigating operator arcs and
  invariant landings.

- **Additional Guides**  
  - How to perform the Sequential Unfolding Hijack  
  - How to classify sentence purposes  
  - How to map invariants to cognitive intuitions  
  - How to construct new examples

This directory is the reference foundation for the entire repository.
Everything in the project flows downward from these documents, and all sentence
studies refer back to their structures.

The Study of Sentences treats geometry and language as isomorphic expressions of
coherence, and the `docs/` folder preserves the theory that makes that claim
explicit.
