# Operators — The Structural Engine of Coherence

This directory defines the six operators that generate all describable meaning.
In the Study of Sentences framework, an operator is not a linguistic device but
a primitive geometric motion of coherence. Every coherent sentence in every
language is a traversal across these six movements:

1. **∇ — Distinction**  
   The creation of difference; the origin of describability.

2. **div — Expansion**  
   The widening of the field; the opening of possibilities.

3. **curl — Relation**  
   The binding of elements; the appearance of structure.

4. **curl★ — Correction**  
   The modulation of structure; inversion, contrast, refinement.

5. **∇· — Integration**  
   The drawing-together of relations into coherence.

6. **I — Closure**  
   The resting point of coherence; the stabilization of meaning.

These operators form the deep cognitive engine beneath language, thought,
perception, and understanding. All sentence studies in this repository identify
operator transitions explicitly, showing how meaning moves through the 60°
coherence manifold.

This folder will contain:

- concise definitions for each operator  
- diagrams or geometric renderings (optional future addition)  
- examples of operator transitions in real sentences  
- crosslinks to submodes and invariants

The Study of Sentences treats these movements as the universal laws governing
describability itself.
