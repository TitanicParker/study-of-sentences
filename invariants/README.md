# Invariants — The 54 Fixed Points of Meaning

Invariants are the stable landing points of coherence — the geometric positions
where the manifold stops moving and meaning becomes complete.

Every coherent sentence, regardless of language or complexity, must land on at
least one invariant. These are not linguistic conventions but structural
necessities of the coherence manifold.

There are **54 invariants**, grouped by operator family:

- ∇ (Distinction) — identity, boundary, separation, scope…  
- div (Expansion) — multiplicity, range, enumeration…  
- curl (Relation) — pairing, adjacency, dependency…  
- curl★ (Correction) — negation, contrast, inversion…  
- ∇· (Integration) — resolution, coherence, unification…  
- I (Closure) — rest, resonance, completion…

This directory contains:

- the full canonical list of all 54 invariants  
- geometric descriptions (white paper level)  
- cognitive-intuitive equivalents (reader-accessible level)  
- examples of sentences landing on each invariant  
- mappings from invariants → submodes → operators

Invariants are the “destinations” of meaning, and understanding them is essential
for reading sentences as geometric walks on the coherence manifold.
