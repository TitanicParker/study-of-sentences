# Sentence Studies — Walking the Geometry

This directory contains complete sentence analyses using the unified Study of
Sentences method. Each study treats a sentence as a closed walk on the 60°
coherence manifold.

A full study includes:

1. **Operator Arc**  
   Identifying the sequence of ∇ → div → curl → curl★ → ∇· → I.

2. **Submodes**  
   Fine-grained inflections within each operator movement.

3. **Invariant Landings**  
   The stabilizing fixed points where meaning stops moving.

4. **Purpose Classification**  
   Identifying the sentence type (perception, request, narrative, metaphysical…).

5. **Sequential Unfolding Hijack (optional)**  
   Revealing the geometry word-by-word to show the narrowing manifold of
   expectation.

6. **Closure Analysis**  
   Where and how the sentence completes its arc.

Sentence studies demonstrate that meaning is not produced by words but by the
geometry of coherence moving through the invariants. Ordinary sentences show
this most clearly, though complex sentences reveal the fullest arc.

This folder will grow into a library of canonical examples.
